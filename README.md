- `car_ID`: Unique identifier for each car entry.
- `CarName`: Name of the car model.
- `price`: Price of the car.
- `Phase`: Indicates if the data belongs to existing or new unseen data.
- `Price Predictions`: Predicted price of the car.

## Visualizations

The PBIX file contains various visualizations, including:

- Scatter plots displaying the relationship between car features such as engine size, horsepower, and price.
- Graphs illustrating the distribution of car prices based on different parameters.
- Filters to interactively explore the data based on engine type, cylinder type, fuel type, and phase (existing or new unseen data).
